# Getting started

Please run make from your local machine.

`make`

This will isntall all dependencies


# Solution

An exampele on how the solution is supposed to run can be found in the `test_board.py`, which was setup to test the first layout.


To find all layouts the solution would be to permutate the order of the chess pieces and run the `get_layout` function in the `ChessBoard` class.
